<h1>👋 Hey everyone</h1>
I am Finnja, a 15(almost 16) year old trans girl from Germany. I love coding, and am interested in web development, app coding, but mostly C++ desktop development!
I also like penetration testing and red teaming as well as cyber forensics and probably want to do something in that direction later on.
I appreciate u coming to check out my page, I am happy to colaborate on Projects, if you are interested.
This is my github: <a href="https://github.com/anon15683">Github</a>
