<h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hey everyone</h1>
I am Finnja, a 15(almost 16) year old trans girl from Germany. I love coding, and am interested in web development, app coding, but mostly C++ desktop development!<br>
I also like penetration testing and red teaming as well as cyber forensics and probably want to do something in that direction later on.<br>
I appreciate u coming to check out my page, I am happy to colaborate on Projects, if you are interested.<br>
